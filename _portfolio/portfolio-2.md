excerpt: "This project analyzes Southern California home prices using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and multiple predictive modeling approaches. We evaluate Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and XGBoost to understand how different algorithms capture the complexity of the market. I worked with a group of fellow students end-to-end starting from an imperfect dataset.
