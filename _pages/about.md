Hi, I’m Soham Pati.

I’m a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech graduating in May 2026 and continuing into the BSMS program with a specialization in Machine Learning.

I focus on applied machine learning and software systems, with experience building end-to-end projects that emphasize ownership and real-world impact. Recently, I’ve been working with Python and Java on ML-driven applications and diving deeper into ML infrastructure and training pipelines.

I’ve built and shipped projects through organizations like Big Data Big Impact and Bits of Good, and I’m looking for roles where I can own meaningful technical work and see it deployed.
